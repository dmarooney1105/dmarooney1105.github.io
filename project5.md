description: I redesigned the spending plan as a step-by-step flow to help users understand the purpose of the spending plan and how they will be using it.
theme: default
user: Millenials between the ages of 23 - 33 struggling to understand finances and pay down debt. Our main focus is the "Struggling Steve/Stacy" who needs to pay off student loans, cover necessary expenses, and needs help with future financial planning. </br></br> This user needs help creating a spending plan to help reach their goals.
problem: The original low-fi mockups and multiple iterations of hi-fi mockups were tested with target users. Users were confused about what actions they needed to take with the spending plan. They also did not understand the connection between creating a spending plan to reach goal of "Spend less than you earn / Avoid New Debt."

    title: Savings Opportunity Screen Low-Fi
    description: This was the first low-fi mock for this screen which included mostly numbers and data instead of explanations and personalization.

    title: Spending Plan Low-Fi
    description: User is unaware of what action to take and seems to resemble more of an excel spreadsheet than an interface. This was one of the first low-fi mocks for the Spending Plan.

    title: Spend Less than You Make Hi-Fi
    description: First hi-fi mock of this interface - you can see the menu is clunkier here and was too confusing and distracting for users.

    title: Spending Plan Hi-Fi
    description: First hi-fi mock of spending plan. The sliders were way too tiny for users and when implemented with all 32 spending categories it became daunting and overwhelming.

    title: Savings Opportunity Hi-Fi
    description: Second or third hi-fi mock of savings opportunity. Users did not connect the suggestions we made with to their spending plan.

    title: Spend less than You Make Low-Fi

      <li>User needs to be able to take action and set spending for "Must-Have" categories prior to landing on spending plan interface.</li>
      <li>Redesigned flow to show how much user could be saving in these "Must-Have" categories and the take action by "committing" to spending less which automatically sets the spending for this category in the spending plan.</li>

      <li>User needs to know how much they are finding in savings as they commit to spending less in each category.</li>
      <li>Designed a progress bar to aggregate as user "commits" to spending less in each category. I also added a check mark on categories they have committed to.</li>
