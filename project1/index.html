ViiMed's only healthcare experience thus far was in Orthopaedics but we knew our Chronic Disease template had to be more engaging for a patient population that was never going to be cured.</p>

<div project-elements="left" class="container default">
  <h2 class="double-pica">The Original Dashboard</h2>
  <p class="long-primer">Most of ViiMed's products up until this point, revolved around orthopedics, and therefore the patient did not need to have a "dashboard." They just logged in and went straight to their activity list. <br /><br /> The Solution Architects used the page builder on the software to create a patient dashboard. The page builder on ViiMed's platform, serves for simple projects such as libraries and such. </p>

  <h2 class="double-pica text-center">Looks boring, right?</h2>
  <p class="long-primer text-center">With the thought of gamification in mind, I decided to begin sketching out wireframes that not only improved the overall look and feel of the dashboard, but also incorporated some gamification elements to it such as: unlocked achievement badges, a trophy room where patients could use their points to purchase a bluetooth inhaler that connected to the platform (or other goodies), etc. </p>

Any "call outs" or "did you know?" blurbs included a graphical cartoon explorer dressed in safari gear. I worked closely with ViiMeds front-end software engineer took their theme of "Lung Island" and expanded upon it by creating different environmental realms that one would travel through on a game board and applied it to the Care Plan Courses. Each aspect of the program (from individual chapters in a course to library resources) was assigned an "environment."</p>

      <p class="long-primer">I created a user survey for patients to fill out while they were completing their program. We asked them all sorts of questions regarding the design, navigation, workflow, and gamification. Most said they really enjoyed the theme and gamification aspect, but that they did not see it as a motivating factor for them. We came to the conclusion that perhaps there was no correlation to motivation because patients could not do anything with their points (e.g., purchase items in a trophy room).
      <br /><br />
      The COPD care plan was up and running. The theme elements and ideas that the Lead UX and UI designer and I developed became a large turning point for how we approached all other care plans. The elements we build were so often reused for other care plans, that we eventually built widgets out of them for solution architects to use instead of copying and pasting HTML code.</p>
